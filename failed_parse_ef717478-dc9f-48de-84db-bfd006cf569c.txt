<think>Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract specific metadata from the DOJ press release. First, I need to go through the provided text carefully.

Starting with the district_office. The press release mentions "U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District of New York," so that's the district office. Got that.

Next, usa_name is Preet Bharara. That's straightforward from the same sentence.

Event_type: The main event here is the extradition, but looking at the options given (indictment, plea, conviction, sentencing, deferred-prosecution, other). The press release says Budovsky was extradited and will be arraigned. The primary event might be the indictment since he was indicted in 2013, but the current event is extradition. Wait, the instructions say the primary legal event described. The title mentions extradition, but the body talks about the indictment and the extradition. However, the event_type options don't include extradition. The options are indictment, plea, etc. Since the press release mentions he was indicted and now extradited, but the main event here is his arrival and upcoming arraignment. Since the options don't have extradition, maybe the event_type is "other"? Or perhaps the indictment is the main legal event. Wait, the user says to choose from the list. The options are indictment, plea, etc. Since the extradition isn't listed, maybe "other" is the right choice here. Alternatively, maybe the event is the arraignment, but that's not in the list either. Hmm. The press release's main focus is his extradition and upcoming court dates. Since the options don't include extradition or arraignment, perhaps the event_type is "other".

Judge_name: The text mentions U.S. Magistrate Judge James C. Francis IV and U.S. District Judge Denise L. Cote. So there are two judges. But the fields are singular. The question is, which one to pick? The event_type might influence this. Since the indictment is mentioned, but the current event is arraignment before Judge Cote. The judge_name field should probably include both? Wait, the instructions say "the full name of the judge mentioned, if any". Since there are two, but the JSON expects a single value. Maybe list both separated by commas? Wait, looking back at the schema, the judge_name is a single string. The example given in the instructions had "U.S. District Judge" as the title. Since there are two judges, perhaps we need to include both. But the user might expect the first one mentioned? Or maybe the one related to the event_type. Alternatively, maybe the judge handling the arraignment is more relevant here. The arraignment is on Oct 14 by Judge Cote. The indictment was already done. Since the event_type is possibly "other", but the main legal event here is the extradition leading to arraignment. Since the judge names are both mentioned, perhaps list both? But the field is a single string. Maybe separate them with commas. Wait, the example in the user's schema shows "judge_name": "value or null", so maybe just pick the first one? Or perhaps the one mentioned in the context of the event. The user might expect both, but since it's a single field, perhaps we need to include both names. Let me check the text again. The text says "presented before U.S. Magistrate Judge James C. Francis IV on Oct. 11, 2014, at 2:00 p.m. Budovsky will be arraigned before U.S. District Judge Denise L. Cote on Oct. 14, 2014". So two judges. Since the field is singular, maybe we can list both separated by commas. But the user's example shows "judge_name": "value or null", so perhaps the answer should include both names. Alternatively, maybe the primary judge is Denise L. Cote since that's the arraignment. But the question is to extract the judge mentioned. Since both are mentioned, perhaps we need to include both. However, the JSON expects a single string. Maybe the user expects both names separated by commas. Let me see the example given in the user's initial prompt. The example had "U.S. District Judge" as the title, so perhaps the judge names are both included. So I'll put both names in the judge_name field, separated by commas.

Judge_title: The first is "U.S. Magistrate Judge", the second is "U.S. District Judge". Since there are two, but the field is singular, perhaps the primary one is the District Judge since that's where the arraignment is. Alternatively, maybe list both titles. But the field is a single string. The user might expect the title of the judge mentioned in the context of the event. Since the arraignment is the main event, the title would be "U.S. District Judge". Alternatively, since both are mentioned, perhaps list both. But the example in the user's schema shows "U.S. District Judge" as a single value. Maybe pick the one related to the arraignment. So "U.S. District Judge".

Case_number: The press release mentions the indictment was unsealed on May 28, 2013, but doesn't provide a case number. So case_number is null.

Max_penalty_text: The text doesn't mention the maximum potential sentence. It talks about the indictment and extradition, but no specific penalties stated here. So null.

Sentence_summary: The press release says four co-defendants have pleaded guilty and await sentencing, but Budovsky's sentence isn't mentioned yet. So null.

Money_amounts: The text mentions "more than $6 billion in funds" and "approximately 55 million transactions". So "$6 billion" and "55 million" (though 55 million is transactions, not money). Wait, the instruction says "significant monetary values mentioned". The $6 billion is a monetary amount. Also, "more than $200,000,000 users in the United States" â€“ no, that's users, not money. So only "$6 billion" is a monetary amount. Wait, the exact quote is "totaling more than $6 billion in funds". So that's one. Are there others? The indictment mentions "billion of dollars in crime proceeds" but that's not a specific number. So money_amounts would be "$6 billion".

Crypto_assets: The text refers to Liberty Reserve as a virtual currency, but doesn't mention specific cryptocurrencies like BTC or ETH. It mentions E-Gold and Gold Age Inc., but those are not cryptocurrencies in the modern sense (like Bitcoin). The problem says to list specific cryptocurrency assets mentioned. Since Liberty Reserve is their own system, but not a known crypto like BTC, maybe it's not included. So crypto_assets is null.

Statutes_json: The indictment mentions charges like operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The user needs the U.S. Code statutes. The text says Budovsky was convicted in New York State of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. That's state law, not federal U.S. Code. The indictment's charges might be under federal statutes. The press release doesn't explicitly state the U.S. Code sections. It mentions money laundering and operating unlicensed businesses, but without specific code references. So statutes_json would be null.

Timeline_json: The key dates are indictment in May 2013, arrest in Spain May 2013 (but when exactly?), extradition arrival in the US (today, but the date isn't given except the announcement's context). The dates mentioned are the presentation before the magistrate on Oct 11, 2014, and arraignment on Oct 14, 2014. The indictment date is mentioned as "indicted by a grand jury in the Southern District of New York" but the exact date isn't given except that the indictment was unsealed May 28, 2013. So the timeline would have "indictment_date": "2013-05-28" (since unsealed on that date, maybe the indictment was returned then?), and "plea_date" for the co-defendants who pleaded guilty, but their plea dates aren't specified. The arrest in Spain was May 2013, but exact date not given. The extradition arrival is "this afternoon" but the press release's date isn't provided. The only specific dates are the court dates in October 2014. Since the event_type might be "other", but the timeline should include the indictment date and the arraignment dates. However, the user's example timeline includes indictment and plea dates. Since the indictment was unsealed on May 28, 2013, that's the indictment date. The plea dates for the co-defendants are not specified, so only the indictment date and maybe the arraignment dates. But the timeline_json should have key-value pairs. The user's example has "indictment_date" and "plea_date". Here, the plea dates for the co-defendants are not given, so perhaps only indictment_date and arraignment_date? But the arraignment is part of the current event. The user's schema allows any key names? The instructions say "key dates, like {"indictment_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "plea_date": "YYYY-MM-DD"}". So perhaps include indictment_date as 2013-05-28, and maybe the arr
